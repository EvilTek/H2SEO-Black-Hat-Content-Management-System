<b>The H₂SEO Black Hat Content Management System is a powerful tool in a very small package leaving you all the room you need to create your Black Hat SEO pages in bulk and grab all the traffic you can handle.</b></div><br>
H₂SEO is a compilation of proven Black Hat SEO Techniques combined with some basic php that delivers great SEO based random content generated pages.<br>
</em>That's a lot of words...</em>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
Pretty simply, the cms displays random pre-loaded content, each time the page is viewed, the content changes.
Normally this would attract attention from crawlers and could be considered less than desireable content, but
with a few little hacks..
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<b>Apache2</b></br>
<b>PhP 5.2+</b></br>
<em>If you're still running 5.2 just hang it up and go home.</em><br>
<b>A simple understanding of:</b>
<em>HTML, Php, FTP, Bash, Cron, SEO, .htaccess, Life.</em>
<h2>Installation:</h2>
Make it easy on yourself, download the zip, unzip it where ever you're going to test it.<br>
Run it, hack it up to your liking and make something great from it.<br>
No frills, no complications, any text editor will do.<br>
I like simple.
