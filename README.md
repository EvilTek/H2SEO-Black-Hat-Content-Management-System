<div align="center"><h2>H2SEO-Black-Hat-Content-Management-System</h2>
<b>The H₂SEO Black Hat Content Management System is a powerful tool in a very small package leaving you all the room you need to create your Black Hat SEO pages in bulk and grab all the traffic you can handle.</b></div><br>
H₂SEO is a compilation of proven Black Hat SEO Techniques combined with some basic php that delivers great SEO based random content generated pages.<br>
</em>That's a lot of words...</em>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
Pretty simply, the cms displays random pre-loaded content, each time the page is viewed, the content changes.
Normally this would attract attention from crawlers and could be considered less than desireable content, but
with a few little hacks..
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<b>Apache2</b></br>
<b>PhP 5.2+</b></br>
<em>If you're still running 5.2 just hang it up and go home.</em><br>
<b>A simple understanding of:</b>
<em>HTML, Php, FTP, Bash, Cron, SEO, .htaccess, Life.</em>
<h2>Installation:</h2>
Make it easy on yourself, download the zip, unzip it where ever you're going to test it.<br>
Run it, hack it up to your liking and make something great from it.<br>
No frills, no complications, any text editor will do.<br>
I like simple.<br>
<h2>Plugins:</h2>
H₂SEO comes with several default plugins.<br>
<b><em>The Hatcher: </em></b>This plugin is relly my favorite part of H₂SEO CMS.<br>
The Hatcher is a Bash script (without the .sh extention) you can run to deploy your new content.
It generates keyword named pages for you, based on the keywords used in the list.txt<br>
The generated pages are stored in the output folder for use with the cronjob detailed in..<br>
<em> /plugins/hatcher/ReadMe.txt</em><br>
<b><em>Keyword Link Tables: </em></b>This plugin provides randomly displayed keyword links throughout the page.<br>
<b><em>PageClone: </em></b>This is an additional use file. You can substitute it for The Hatcher's index.php or simply<br>
just hijack content with it.<br>
<b><em>Random Banners: </em></b>Simple banner rotator used in the footer.<br>
<b><em>Random Headlines: </em></b>Radomly displayed H1 tags with some pretty nifty css.<br>
<b><em>Random Titles: </em></b>Yes, Random page titles. Pretty fun to watch your results.<br>
<b><em>Simple Contact Form: </em></b>Yes, exactly that.<br>
<b><em>Simple Logger: </em></b>He cuts down arborvitae and shrubs.<br>
Simple Logger compiles your site traffic into a csv file and when used with cronjobs is really a<br>
great way to monitor your results.<br>
<b><em>Site Submit: </em></b>Bing is due to close down it's anonymous submit here soon, but for now<br>
it still seems to be working. This php file submits to both Google and Bing when viewed.<br>
I highly recommend changing the file name and stashing it somewhere your visitors are unlikely to find.<br>
I recommend using cronjobs with this too and have included Read Me files for most of the plugins.<br><br>
