<h2><strong>When editing your pulp and core files Do Not Hit Enter until you are done with a "single line" of code, meaning that a carriage return or enter will create a new line breaking your content block. It's best to close your tags before hitting enter.<br>This is use of the line break or &lt;br&gt; tag. If your content needs a carriage return then use the &lt;br&gt; tag and not the enter key!</strong><em><br>Just some friendly overclarification</em></h2>
<p>This is the pulp file, the second part of the random content placement. When you are editing these files do not leave blank lines unless you intent to serve up blank content. I don't know why anyone would want to serve up blank content, but well.. people are strange.<p>
