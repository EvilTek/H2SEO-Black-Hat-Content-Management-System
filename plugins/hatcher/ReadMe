Hâ‚‚SEO Hatcher Plugin

Instructions:

The Hatcher is part of the black hat seo exploit that leads search engines to believe
that the index.php and any other included files have been modified on a regular basis and improve overall ranking.
This will generate a copy of your latest index.php and generate keyword.php files
based on the text entered into the list.txt.

Edit list.txt to your linked page names, ie: keywords-are-good or somefile (sample lines included).
The Banker will generate a keywords-are-good.php file to the output folder.
Using multiple lines will generate multiple keyword php files, but if you do not
link to them individually it won't do you much good to use this feature.

If you are not familiar with cronjobs or scripting up an automated process, you can always
manually copy the page to your root directory.

Using a cronjob to copy the index.php from The Hatcher into the root directory.
This is the highest recommended setting.

0	*	*	*	*	cp public_html/or_path_to_dir/plugins/hatcher/output/index.php public_html/or_path_to_dir/index.php >/dev/null

Setting the cronjob any faster won't do any good and one hour is sufficient.

Using Telnet / SSH
1: Upload all Hatcher files to the plugins folder.
2: Connect to your server.
3: cd /path/to/hatcher/
4: $chmod +x banker
5: $ ./banker

This will generate all your output files on the server.
Cronjob:
0	*	*	*	*	cp -r public_html/your-site-root/plugins/hatcher/output/. public_html/your-site-root/ >/dev/null

The . will copy all files (wildcard use)
